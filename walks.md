There are many walks of varying lengths, sights and ease of access.

## Ouse Valley Way
The 150 mile-long Ouse Valley Way is a fascinating cross-section through England. It's a chance to discover how the country has been shaped by the river and allowed our ancestors to prosper. It passes through ancient villages, new towns and communities of the future.

Seing how our country has come to be as it is poses questions about the future. You'll get the chance to meet some of the people for whom the river plays a part of their daily lives.

The walk is described below in three sections and reflects the different character of each stretch of the river.
### Headwaters: Syresham to Bedford 
In this part we'll be spending time following the streams, brooks and ditches and walking through fields with the occaional sight of a hare or deer but usually accompanied by the sound of blackbirds, great tits and skylarks.
#### Syresham to Buckingham (12 km)
> ~~every thousand mile journey starts with a single step~~
> getting lost is part of the journey

The first part of the way starts near the source of the river in [Syresham](./places/syresham.html). For purists, near might not feel near enough and they would like to start at the actual source. If so, you could walk up the road towards Wappenham where there is a puddle by Wappenham Lodge Farm. However, the source is contested as there is a more westerly spring in Farthinghoe with the appropriate name of Ouse Well.

There are [26 waterbodies](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3491) that feed in to the headwaters of the Great Ouse. Feel free to start at a different point if you'd like - it's not cheating, it's just how freshwater works.

If every journey starts with a single step then doesn't every river start with a rain drop?

Syresham does have advantages as a starting point.
- It's as near to the *official* source as you can get and also be on a bus route. Check out the [Syresham page](./places/syresham.html) to find out how to get there.
- It can also set the tone for the journey ahead. It's the sort of place where sitting in the King's Head garden, on a park bench or at St James' church can feel timeless, but it's only showing one side of Syresham. Once a year it swarms with people and a helicopter flightpath as the world focuses on nearly Silverstone. And then on Monday the village goes back to normal. Meanwhile a collection of high-tech industries all set on pushing technology to its boundaries ready for the next season.

The route is a little bit confusing at the start and not all the landowners help to keep the paths clear.

After a while you'll have the landmark of Wolf's Obelisk at [Stowe](./places/stowe.html) to help you navigate. Stowe Gardens are well worth a detour and you can pick up something to read along the way from from their pretty impressive second-hand bookshop.

[Buckingham](./places/buckingham.html) is a good place to get provisions if you're just passing through or stay overnight. It's also where you can meet local volunteers who look after their river and its surrounds.

#### Buckingham to Stony Stratford (14 km)
Leaving Buckingham takes us along a short stretch of the old canal which has been turned into a wildlife habitat. If you pass through on a Tuesday or Thursday you might see members of the [Canal Society](https://www.buckinghamcanal.org.uk/) carrying out maintenance.

There are a couple of issues with the route which have been marked on the route. 

Beachampton has a pub.

#### Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell (17 km)
The ancient coaching town of Stony Stratford was, as the name suggests, a passing point across the Great Ouse for travellers along Watling Street up to the north and west of England.
Cock and Bull

Now it's part of the city of Milton Keynes, which takes its name from one of the 13 villages and towns that were incorporated. If your only notion of MK is roundabouts and concrete cows, you will be in for an education.

Crossing Milton Keynes is a chance to see how tricky questions of development have been tackled and decide for yourself if they got it right. There are several options for taking different routes and the [redways](https://getaroundmk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MK_Redway_Poster.pdf) are a great way to explore some of the sites - you could even hire a bike or scooter for some or all of the way.

Newport Pagnell mirrors Stony Stratford as an old town at the edge of MK. It has the only vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom and is the original home of Aston Martin.

#### Newport Pagnell to Turvey (19 km)
From Newport to route goes mainly along roads to Sherington where a curious event took place in 1935. The route takes a long detour towards Tyringham. A shorter alternative route is marked on the map. The route goes through Emberton Country Park leading to Olney.

#### Turvey to Harrold
Pleasant but little sight of the river

#### Harrold to Bedford
circuitous route with little riverside time. Might want to consider one of the alternative routes.
Sharnbrook has places to eat
Route takes past Felmersham without stopping - might want to make a detour
From Pavenham the route is back on the river
SSSi site
Stevington holy well, post mill and village characters
Heading in to Bedford is a bit dissapointing - might want to consider one of the alternative routes
Things to do in Bedford
### Navigation: Bedford to Ely
From the retreat of the Romans to the industrial revolution, it's fair to say that England wasn't very easy to get around. Towns prospered when they were on navigable rivers allowing trade to flow. From Bedford onwards we'll see a series of places that have benefitted from those trade links and see how they have managed the tricky business of managing water.

#### Bedford to Roxton
This is a very pleasant stroll taking in Bedford's parklands, former railway lines and passing the pretty Willington Dovecote 
Roxton congregational church
#### Roxton to St Neots
Major developments underway
cross the A1 and walk along it
#### St Neots to Godmanchester
Well marked trail with information boards.

#### Godmanchester to St Ives
some paths a little bit confusing but generally well marked and quite accessible
pass Houghton Mill where people paddle
Holt island at St Ives
#### St Ives to Earith
#### Earith to Ely
### Fenslands: Ely to KingsLynn
