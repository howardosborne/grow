        <p>There are many walks along the Great Ouse of varying lengths, sights and ease of access. The longest is the Ouse Valley Way.</p>

<h2 id="ouse-valley-way">Ouse Valley Way</h2>
<p>The 150 mile-long Ouse Valley Way is a fascinating cross-section through England. It’s a chance to discover how the country has been shaped by the river and allowed our ancestors to prosper. It passes through ancient villages, new towns and communities of the future.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/grow.png" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<p>Seing how our country has come to be as it is poses questions about the future. You’ll get the chance to meet some of the people for whom the river plays a part of their daily lives.</p>

<p>The walk is described below in three sections and reflects the different character of each stretch of the river. There is also an <a href="#interactive-map">interactive map</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-headwaters-syresham-to-bedford">Part 1 Headwaters: Syresham to Bedford</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><del>every thousand mile journey starts with a single step</del></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>getting lost is part of the journey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this part we’ll be spending time following the streams, brooks and ditches and walking through fields with the occaional sight of a hare or deer but usually accompanied by the sound of blackbirds, great tits and skylarks.</p>

<p>It’s fair to say that maintenance of this part of the Way has been rather neglected in parts. Known issues are marked on the map, as are alternative routes.</p>

<h4 id="1-syresham-to-buckingham-12-km">1. Syresham to Buckingham (12 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1.png" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<p>The first part of the way starts <em>near</em> the source of the river in <a href="./places/syresham.html">Syresham</a>.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/The%20source%20of%20the%20Great%20Ouse.jpg" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<h5 id="where-is-the-source">Where is the source?</h5>
<p>For purists, near might not feel near enough and they would like to start at the actual source.
If so, you could walk up the road towards Wappenham where there is a puddle by Wappenham Lodge Farm. However, the source is contested as there is a more westerly spring in Farthinghoe with the appropriate name of Ouse Well.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3491">26 waterbodies</a> that feed in to the headwaters of the Great Ouse. Feel free to start at a different point if you’d like - it’s not cheating, it’s just how freshwater works.</p>

<p>If every journey starts with a single step then doesn’t every river start with a rain drop?</p>

<p>Syresham does have the obvious advantage that it’s on a bus route. Check out the <a href="./places/syresham.html">Syresham</a> page to find out how to get there.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/pub%20in%20Syresham.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the route is a little bit confusing at the start and not all the landowners help to keep the paths clear. Following the road to Biddlesden is not a bad way to start.</p>

<p>After a while you’ll have the landmark of Wolf’s Obelisk at <a href="./places/stowe.html">Stowe</a> to help you navigate. Stowe Gardens are well worth a detour and you can pick up something to read along the way from from their pretty impressive second-hand bookshop.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Corinthian%20Arch%20at%20Stowe.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>From Stowe it’s a pleasant wander down Stowe Avenue, shaded by majestic beeches, down to the gate houses that demark the estate from the town.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Stowe%20Avenue%202.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p><a href="./places/buckingham.html">Buckingham</a> is a good place to get provisions if you’re just passing through or stay overnight. It’s also where you can meet local volunteers who look after their river and its surrounds.</p>

<h4 id="2-buckingham-to-stony-stratford-15-km">2. Buckingham to Stony Stratford (15 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/2.png" alt="syresham to buckingham to stony" /></p>

<p>Leaving Buckingham takes us along a short stretch of the old canal which has been turned into a wildlife habitat. If you pass through on a Tuesday or Thursday you might see members of the <a href="https://www.buckinghamcanal.org.uk/">Canal Society</a> carrying out maintenance.</p>

<div class="row">

</div>
</div>

<p>Much of the route to up to Thornton follows the old canal and it’s worth noting the different species of plant that grow in the old canal bed.
<img src="./assets/images/1/plants%20growing%20in%20former%20canal%20at%20Thornton.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>There are a couple of issues with the route, particularly beyond Thornton, which have been <a href="#interactive-map">marked on the map</a>.</p>

<p>At Beachampton there’s a nice church and a pub where you can get some refreshments.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/Beachampton%20church%202.jpg" alt="Beachampton" /></p>

<p>Arriving at the Lower Wield of Calverton marks the entry into the city of Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes (MK as the locals call it) takes its name from one of the 13 villages and towns that were incorporated into the new conurbation and if your only notion of MK is roundabouts and concrete cows, you will be in for a treat.</p>

<p>It’s just a short wander into the ancient coaching town of Stony Stratford which was, as the name suggests, the place where Watling Street crossed the Great Ouse (street ford). 
It’s a good place to stay or at least get something to eat and drink and why not do as travellers in the past did and go to either the Cock Inn or the Bull Hotel. What did travellers used to talk about? Who knows, but we’ve ended up with any tall tale being a Cock and Bull story.</p>

<h4 id="3-stony-stratford-to-newport-pagnell-165-km">3. Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell (16.5 km)</h4>

<p>Crossing Milton Keynes is a chance to see how tricky questions of development have been tackled and decide for yourself if they got it right.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/3.png" alt="syresham to buckingham to stony" /></p>

<p>There are several options for taking different routes and one alternative is marked on the map. The city is also served by a network of walkable / cycleable routes known as the Redways and are a great way to explore some of the sites - you could even hire a bike or scooter for some or all of the way. <a href="https://getaroundmk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MK_Redway_Poster.pdf">download redways map</a></p>

<p>The end point is the town of Newport Pagnell which mirrors Stony Stratford as an old place at the edge of MK. It has the only vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom and is the original home of Aston Martin.</p>

<h4 id="4-newport-pagnell-to-olney-14-km">4. Newport Pagnell to Olney (14 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/4.png" alt="NP Olney" /></p>

<p>From Newport Pagnell the route crosses the Great Ouse at the weir</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/Great%20Ouse%20at%20Newport%20Pagnell.jpg" alt="NP" /></p>

<p>and heads to Sherington where a curious event took place in 1935. Deligations from long time rivals Oxford and Cambridge Universities met here and dug a hole. They buried a small axe as a symbol that it was time to put their rivalries to oneside and, as they both did and said, bury the hatchett.</p>

<p>There’s also a nice path up to the church.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Sherington%20church.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The official route takes a long detour towards Tyringham, which never quite reaches the manor. If you would like to see these, a way has been added to the map. Alternatively, a more direct route is also marked on the map in case you would rather spend your time amusing yourself in Olney. The route also goes through Emberton Country Park which leads up to a weir and sluice system for managing water.</p>

<p>Olney is a confortable Georgian town and as the signs say, the ‘home of Amazing Grace’. You might want to spend some time here finding out more at the <a href="https://cowperandnewtonmuseum.org.uk/">Cowper and Newton museum</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also home to <a href="http://olneypancakerace.org/">pancake racing</a>, but if you’re here at the wrong time of year, you could always make up your own race with something from the <a href="https://www.olneypancakeparlour.co.uk/">Pancake Parlour</a>.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/5.png" alt="Olney Odell" /></p>

<p>From Olney the route heads across meadows where locals often go paddling and swimming despite warnings not to and up the hill to the village of Clifton Reynes.</p>

<div class="col">

</div>

<p>The village has a community pub, a theatre and a church with some eye-catching tombs.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/clifton_reynes_3.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The way then continues to Turvey in Bedfordshire</p>

<p>where the Great Ouse marks the border.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/turvey_border.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>Turvey is a pleasant village, despite having to manage a fair weight of passing traffic, and a good place to get provisions.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/turvey.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The church also contains a curious mauseleum for the local big-wigs. Note the depth of the bricked-in door at the front…</p>

<h4 id="6-odell-to-pavenham-105-km">6. Odell to Pavenham (10.5 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/6.png" alt="Odell Pavenham" /></p>

<p>The route from Odell to Pavenham broadly follows the shape of the wending river and yet seems to completely miss it at the same time, which is a shame. Nevertheless, Sharnbrook is a good place for pub-based provisions and accommodation. Making a detour into Felmersham is also worth considering. People use the ramp by the bridge at Felmersham for paddling and swimming.</p>

<p>A shorter alternative route is marked on the map.</p>

<h4 id="6-pavenham-to-bedford-155-km">6. Pavenham to Bedford (15.5 km)</h4>

<h3 id="navigation-bedford-to-ely">Navigation: Bedford to Ely</h3>
<p>From the retreat of the Romans to the industrial revolution, it’s fair to say that England wasn’t very easy to get around. Towns prospered when they were on navigable rivers allowing trade to flow. From Bedford onwards we’ll see a series of places that have benefitted from those trade links and see how they have managed the tricky business of managing water.</p>
