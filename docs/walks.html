        <p>There are many walks along the Great Ouse of varying lengths, sights and ease of access. The longest is the Ouse Valley Way.</p>

<h2 id="ouse-valley-way">Ouse Valley Way</h2>
<p>The 150 mile-long Ouse Valley Way is a fascinating cross-section through England. It’s a chance to discover how the country has been shaped by the river and allowed our ancestors to prosper. It passes through ancient villages, new towns and communities of the future.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/grow.png" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<p>Seing how our country has come to be as it is poses questions about the future. You’ll get the chance to meet some of the people for whom the river plays a part of their daily lives.</p>

<p>The walk is described below in three sections and reflects the different character of each stretch of the river.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#headwaters-syresham-to-bedford">Headwaters: Syresham to Bedford</a></li>
  <li><a href="#the-navigable-river-bedford-to-ely">The Navigable River: Bedford to Earith</a></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><del>every thousand mile journey starts with a single step</del></p>

  <p>getting lost is part of the journey</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/headwaters.png" alt="headwaters" /></p>

<p>In this part we’ll be spending time following the streams, brooks and ditches and walking through fields with the occaional sight of a hare or deer but usually accompanied by the sound of blackbirds, great tits and skylarks.</p>

<p>It’s fair to say that maintenance of this part of the Way has been rather neglected in parts. Known issues are marked on the map, as are alternative routes.</p>

<h4 id="1-syresham-to-buckingham-12-km">1. Syresham to Buckingham (12 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1.png" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<p>The first part of the way starts <em>near</em> the source of the river in <a href="./places/syresham.html">Syresham</a>.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/The%20source%20of%20the%20Great%20Ouse.jpg" alt="syresham to buckingham" /></p>

<h5 id="where-is-the-source">Where is the source?</h5>
<p>For purists, near might not feel near enough and they would like to start at the actual source.
If so, you could walk up the road towards Wappenham where there is a puddle by Wappenham Lodge Farm. However, the source is contested as there is a more westerly spring in Farthinghoe with the appropriate name of Ouse Well.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3491">26 waterbodies</a> that feed in to the headwaters of the Great Ouse. Feel free to start at a different point if you’d like - it’s not cheating, it’s just how freshwater works.</p>

<p>If every journey starts with a single step then doesn’t every river start with a rain drop?</p>

<p>Syresham does have the obvious advantage that it’s on a bus route. Check out the <a href="./places/syresham.html">Syresham</a> page to find out how to get there.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/pub%20in%20Syresham.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the route is a little bit confusing at the start and not all the landowners help to keep the paths clear. Following the road to Biddlesden is not a bad way to start.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After a while you’ll have the landmark of Wolf’s Obelisk at <a href="./places/stowe.html">Stowe</a> to help you navigate. Stowe Gardens are well worth a detour and you can pick up something to read along the way from from their pretty impressive second-hand bookshop.</p>

</div>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Corinthian%20Arch%20at%20Stowe.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>From Stowe it’s a pleasant wander down Stowe Avenue, shaded by majestic beeches, down to the gate houses that demark the estate from the town.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Stowe%20Avenue%202.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p><a href="./places/buckingham.html">Buckingham</a> is a good place to get provisions if you’re just passing through or stay overnight. It’s also where you can meet local volunteers who look after their river and its surrounds.</p>

<h4 id="2-buckingham-to-stony-stratford-15-km">2. Buckingham to Stony Stratford (15 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/2.png" alt="syresham to buckingham to stony" /></p>

<p>Leaving Buckingham takes us along a short stretch of the old canal which has been turned into a wildlife habitat. If you pass through on a Tuesday or Thursday you might see members of the <a href="https://www.buckinghamcanal.org.uk/">Canal Society</a> carrying out maintenance.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/Buckingham%20canal.jpg" alt="syresham to buckingham" />

<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/Great%20Ouse%20from%20Buckingham.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />
</div>
</div>

<p>Much of the route to up to Thornton follows the old canal and it’s worth noting the different species of plant that grow in the old canal bed.
<img src="./assets/images/1/plants%20growing%20in%20former%20canal%20at%20Thornton.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>There are a couple of issues with the route, particularly beyond Thornton, which have been <a href="#interactive-map">marked on the map</a>.</p>

<p>At Beachampton there’s a nice church and a pub where you can get some refreshments.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/Beachampton%20church%202.jpg" alt="Beachampton" /></p>

<p>Arriving at the Lower Wield of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calverton,_Buckinghamshire">Calverton</a> marks the entry into the city of Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes (MK as the locals call it) takes its name from one of the 13 villages and towns that were incorporated into the new conurbation and if your only notion of MK is roundabouts and concrete cows, you will be in for a treat.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">

</div>
</div>

<p>It’s just a short wander into the ancient coaching town of Stony Stratford which was, as the name suggests, the place where Watling Street crossed the Great Ouse (street ford). 
It’s a good place to stay or at least get something to eat and drink and why not do as travellers in the past did and go to either the Cock Inn or the Bull Hotel and tell your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock_and_bull_story">Cock and Bull story</a>.</p>

<h4 id="3-stony-stratford-to-newport-pagnell-165-km">3. Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell (16.5 km)</h4>

<p>Crossing Milton Keynes is a chance to see how tricky questions of development have been tackled and decide for yourself if they got it right.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/3.png" alt="syresham to buckingham to stony" /></p>

<p>There are several options for taking different routes and alternatives are marked on the map. The city is also served by a network of walkable/cycleable/scootable routes known as the Redways and are a great way to explore some of the sites - you could even hire a bike or scooter for some or all of the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://getaroundmk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MK_Redway_Poster.pdf">download redways map</a></p>

<p>The end point is the town of Newport Pagnell which mirrors Stony Stratford as an old place at the edge of MK. It has the only vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom and is the original home of Aston Martin.</p>

<h4 id="4-newport-pagnell-to-olney-14-km">4. Newport Pagnell to Olney (14 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/4.png" alt="NP Olney" /></p>

<p>From Newport Pagnell the route crosses the Great Ouse at the weir</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/Great%20Ouse%20at%20Newport%20Pagnell.jpg" alt="NP" /></p>

<p>and heads to Sherington where a curious event took place in 1935. Deligations from long time rivals Oxford and Cambridge Universities met here to dig a hole and place a small axe in it. What better way to symbolise the ending of their rivalries by burying the hatchet.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">

</div>

<p>There’s also a nice path up to the church.</p>

<div class="row">

</div>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/Sherington%20church.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The official route takes a long detour towards Tyringham, but doesn’t quite reach John Soane’s striking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyringham_Hall">Tyringham Hall</a>. The house isn’t open to the public but you can see the gatehouse and bridge and a diversion to these has been added to the map. Alternatively, a more direct route is also marked on the map in case you would rather spend your time amusing and <a href="https://cowperandnewtonmuseum.org.uk/">amazing</a> yourself in Olney. The route also goes through Emberton Country Park which leads up to a weir and sluice system for managing water.</p>

<p>Olney is a comfortable Georgian town and as the signs say, the ‘home of Amazing Grace’. You might want to spend some time here finding out more at the <a href="https://cowperandnewtonmuseum.org.uk/">Cowper and Newton museum</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also home to <a href="http://olneypancakerace.org/">pancake racing</a>, but if you’re here at the wrong time of year, you could always make up your own race with something from the <a href="https://www.olneypancakeparlour.co.uk/">Pancake Parlour</a>.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/5.png" alt="Olney Odell" /></p>

<p>From Olney the route heads across meadows where locals often go paddling and swimming despite warnings not to and up the hill to the village of Clifton Reynes.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/olney_meadows.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />

<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/path_to_clifton_reynes.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />

</div>

<p>The village has a community pub, a theatre and a church with some eye-catching tombs.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/clifton_reynes_3.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The way then continues to Turvey in Bedfordshire</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">

<div class="col">

</div>

<p>where the Great Ouse marks the border.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/turvey_border.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>Turvey is a pleasant village, despite having to manage a fair weight of passing traffic, and a good place to get provisions.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/turvey.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The church also contains a curious mauseleum for the local big-wigs which suggests that there is more to it than meets the eye - look a the bricked-in door at the front…</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/Turvey%20memorial.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />

<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/turvey%20memorial%202.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />
</div>
</div>

<p>The route leaves the river behind and continues over farmland to Carlton where <a href="http://www.thefoxatcarlton.pub/">The Fox</a> will serve up lunch or a real ale liquid lunch - it prides itself on its CAMRA awards.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/1/fox.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The route then drops down to Harrold via a bridge that is well used to dealing with flooding.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col">
<img src="./assets/images/1/harrold_bridge.jpg" class="rounded card-img-top" alt="..." />

</div>
</div>

<p><a href="https://hocp.co.uk/">Harrold Odell Country Park</a> is one of several accessible nature-rich habitats that have been created thanks to quarrying for sand and gravel. There’s a visitor centre, cafe and pay-by-donation car park. The bridge is also a popular place for bathers and paddlers heading towards Felmersham.</p>

<p>The route to Odell is entirely through the Country Park.</p>

<h4 id="6-odell-to-pavenham-105-km">6. Odell to Pavenham (10.5 km)</h4>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/6.png" alt="Odell Pavenham" /></p>

<p>The route from Odell to Pavenham makes a long loop, as does the wending river and yet seems to completely miss it, which is a shame. Even the part which does follow the course of the river is obscured.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/odell_church.jpg" alt="Odell Pavenham" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sharnbrook is a good place for pub-based provisions and accommodation. Making a detour into Felmersham is worth the walk. When Niklaus Pevsner surveyed Bedfordshire for his epic series of books on the architecture of Britain, he put this church at the top of the list. The bridge is also a place where people come to bathe and paddle despite the various problems over the years with the Odell sewage treatment plant upstream.</p>

<p>A shorter alternative route is marked on the map in case you would like to spend your time on some of the special places to come.</p>

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/1/shelter.jpg" alt="Odell Pavenham" /></p>

<p>The village of Pavenham is rare for having a phone box with an actual phone in it (not working) and a collection of pretty cottages.</p>

<div class="row">

<p><img class="rounded card-img-top" src="./assets/images/7.png" alt="Pavenham to Bedford" /></p>

<p>From Pavenham the route is back on the river and follows a sloping to the river. Some of the gound is marshy all year round which is an inconveience for walkers but a delight for nature. As a result, it has earned its status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

<p>The constant flow of water from the limestone ridge to the river takes on a different significance at Stevington. Here people come from far and wide to fill up bottles of water from a holy well which passes under St Mary’s church (and graveyard).</p>

<p>The village has a community-run shop in the village hall and if you are passing through on a Wednesday, you are welcome to join the locals for lunch.</p>

<p>The route carries on crossing over the old railway line and past the Stevington postmill.</p>

<p>Continuing into Bromham, the route meets back up with the Great Ouse at Bromham Mill. It’s now a nice park and popular cafe and is next to Bromham Bridge which is not pedestrian friendly.</p>

<p>The official route continues along the riverside and is accompanied by the unrelenting sound of traffic from the A6 before ducking unexpectedly into a housing estate at Great Denham. Alternative routes have been marked on the map…</p>

<p>Heading into town, you’ll pass near to the <a href="http://gngbedford.org/">Guru Nanak Gudwara Temple</a> and Eagle Brewery which is not open to the public.</p>

<p>Bedford makes the most of its river setting and a stroll through the parks that run along the river is a chance to see how it is actively used by local schools and enthusiats alike for rowing and kayaking.</p>

<p>Spending time in Bedford is also a chance to visit the John Bunyan museum and visit the Panacea Society.</p>

<p>From the retreat of the Romans to the industrial revolution, it’s fair to say that England wasn’t very easy to get around. Towns prospered when they were on navigable rivers allowing trade to flow.</p>

<p>From Bedford onwards we’ll see a series of places that have benefitted from those trade links and see how they have dealt the tricky business of managing water.</p>
