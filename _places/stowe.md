What could be more quintessentially English than gardening?

In terms of scale and quality, there is little to match Stowe as an English garden on the grandest scale. As well as being a 'Capability' Brown masterpiece, it's also filled with temples and monuments stacked with meaning. 

There is a cafe, giftshop and pretty impressive second-hand bookshop.

What there isn't is a village, which was cleared to make way for the House and gardens.
