Syresham is a pretty village on the Northhamptonshire side of the border with Buckinghamshire.

The nearby limestone quarry was used to make many of its older buildings.

The 1,000 or so residents get together as part of a number of local community groups including a WI, gardening club and history society. However, they struggle to get parish councilors.
