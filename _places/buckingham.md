Old market town with a selection of places to eat and drink. Market days are Tuesday and Saturday which take over Market Hill and the High Street cattle pens. 

The architectural highlight is the Old Gaol which was built to help revive the town's fortunes after the great fire. Alas, it didn't do the trick and county town status has stayed with Aylesbury ever since. 

As if losing its status wasn't enough, the town has also lost its railway and its canal (which is part of the next walk).

Luckily each of these loses has come with a silver lining. The Gaol is now a small and friendly museum. The railway track is a pleasant stroll and the canal forms part of the Ouse Valley Way.

Locals have taken the initiative on looking after their river and its surroundings. Each year the local sub-aqua clube help out with a river rinse.

The river wardens also monitor the river and its banks with regular monitoring. If you are coming through on a Friday, you can join them in one of their riverfly surveys.

If you are here on a Sunday, you could meet the locals who tend the Edible Garden. If you have forgotten to bring any provisions with you, why not see what they have to offer?
